Konus experiments
=================

Konus-Wind 
----------
Konus-Wind (KW, [#Aptekar_1995]_) consists of two identical NaI(Tl) detectors S1 and S2,
each with a :math:`2 \pi` field of view. The detectors are mounted on
opposite faces of the rotationally stabilized Wind [#Wind_Polar]_ spacecraft,
such that one detector (S1) points toward the south ecliptic
pole, thereby observing the south ecliptic hemisphere, while the
other (S2) observes the north ecliptic hemisphere. Each
detector has an effective area of :math:`\sim 80–160\:\mathrm{cm}^2` depending on
the photon energy and incident angle. The nominal energy
range of gamma-ray measurements covers the incident photon
energy interval from 13 keV up to 10 MeV.
In interplanetary space far outside the Earthʼs magnetosphere,
KWhas the advantages over Earth-orbiting GRB
monitors of continuous coverage, uninterrupted by Earth
occultation, and a steady background, undistorted by passages
through the Earthʼs trapped radiation, and subject only to
occasional solar particle events. The Wind distance from Earth
as a function of time is presented in Palʼshin et al. (2013). The
maximum distance was :math:`\sim 7` lt-s in 2002 January and May; since
2004 Wind has been in a Lissajous orbit at the L1 libration point
of the Sun–Earth system at a distance of :math:`\sim 5` lt-s.
